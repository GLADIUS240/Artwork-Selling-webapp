	<h2 class="sub-heading">My Artistic Journey</h2>
	<p class="description">Like most of the people I was also bad at art but due to one of my classmate who made a lot of fun of my art for a whole day. I started improving it and after sometime even the whole class got to know that I am out of their league Today he’s one of them who asks about my latest artwork photographs to show their friends. Over the years, I have honed my skills and still developing my unique style that blends "traditional techniques with modern elements".</p>
